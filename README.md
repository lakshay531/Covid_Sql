In this project, I have conducted extensive data exploration using SQL on COVID-19 mortality data sourced from Our World in Data. With over 85,000 database records and utilizing a range of SQL techniques, including Joins, Common Table Expressions, and Aggregate functions the analysis was focused on key aspects such as the percentage of the population infected, identifying countries with the highest infection rates, and determining death counts per population across more than 190 countries. By leveraging these insights, I aimed to provide a comprehensive understanding of the global COVID-19 situation, aiding decision-making and strategic planning in public health and policy domains.
